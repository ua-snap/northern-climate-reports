              Northern Climate Reports would not be possible without
              contributions from a wide variety of climate science
              professionals. These include ecosystem modelers and boreal
              ecologists who interpret and look for patterns in massive amounts
              of data, plus geospatial data analysts and software developers who
              verify the data and create visualizations that aid understanding.
              Science communicators and administrative staff round out the team,
              using graphic design, writing, and organizational skills to help
              this tool work for a wide variety of users.

              Dr. Amy Breen is an expert in Arctic vegetation ecology, short-
              and long-term effects of climate change and disturbance on
              vegetation. Her research interests include field studies and
              modeling to understand and forecast changes in Arctic terrestrial
              ecosystems, particularly the response of vegetation to disturbance
              and climate change.

              Dr. Jeremy Littell is a Research Ecologist with the Alaska Climate
              Adaptation Science Center (CASC). He conducts research on the role
              of climate and ecological drought in Alaska and other forested
              ecosystems. He also facilitates the use of climate information in
              planning, adaptation, and vulnerability assessment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Littell&rsquo;s background is the ecoclimatology of western North
              America's forests. His doctoral work at the University of
              Washington focused on ecological and climatic controls on wildfire
              in the western US and the role of climate in Douglas-fir tree
              growth across its climatic range. He also worked as a research
              scientist at the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group,
              collaborating with resource managers in federal and state agencies
              to better understand and use climate information in planning and
              adaptation.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the Alaska CASC, his current work addresses two main themes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Development, coordination, and translation of climate science
                products for Alaska
              </li>

              Dr. John Walsh is an expert in Arctic climate, weather, climate
              change adaptation and sea ice who has worked at the University of
              Alaska Fairbanks International Arctic Research Center for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specialties include climate modeling, addressing regional
              vulnerabilities, downscaling models and more. His research has
              long focused on Arctic sea ice, and he worked to establish the
              Historical Sea Ice Atlas, a long-term database of sea ice levels
              back to the 1850s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among many other awards, Dr. Walsh was the winner of the 2022 Mohn
              Prize for his outstanding research in the Arctic. In addition to
              extensive scientific publications, Walsh has regularly served as
              an author or editor of official climate reports such as the Arctic
              Extreme Events chapter of AMAP's Climate Update report (2021) and
              a new Report Card section on Arctic Precipitation in the BAMS
              State of the Climate (2022).

              The official assessment efforts to which John has contributed
              serve to evaluate, integrate, and communicate recent science
              research, primarily for public leaders and decision makers. He has
              aimed to provide a balanced perspective on Alaska’s recent changes
              in the face of both growing interest and comparatively sparse data
              resources in the region.
