              change over time. Use these to better understand and reduce risk,

              To help you use the data outside fo the tool, we have also developed
               a user guide that shows how to use the health and demographic 
               information available in the tool alongside the climate projections
                to help you understand who may be most impacted by these changes.

            <p>
              <strong>Temperatures are rising.</strong> Earlier springs, warmer
              summers, later autumns, and less severe winters are changing the
              mix of species on the Northern landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Permafrost is thawing.</strong> This alters surface
              drainage and increases possible rooting depths, yielding
              ecological shifts.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Wildfires are more frequent.</strong> More
              early-succession and fewer late-succession vegetation species
              appear across landscapes.

            Best practices for using climate projections
          </h2>
          <div class="content is-size-5">
            <p>
              <strong>Think broadly.</strong> Climate projections are most
              reliable when averaged across time or space because daily
              variations are &ldquo;smoothed out.&rdquo; Examples:
              &ldquo;projected average of 30 years of winter precipitation for
              Bethel, Alaska&rdquo; or &ldquo;projected hottest temperature for
              the north coast of Alaska.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>What seems most likely?</strong> The climate we will
              experience will not look exactly like any one projection, but it
              will look like a lot of them. So, plan for the likely range of
              climates, impacts, and risks for the time frame and region
              you&rsquo;re working with.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Don&rsquo;t wait!</strong>
              Projections are always improving, but don&rsquo;t wait for a
              better one&mdash;you&rsquo;ll always be waiting, and the costs of
              waiting will increase. Instead, plan for the range of historical
              variability plus the range of climates described by a moderate or
              higher warming model under a high emissions scenario.

              These models provide a range that brackets average outputs across
              all CMIP5 models, and also perform well in Northern regions.

                <strong
                  >Use multiple decades and historical comparisons.</strong
                >
                Longer-term averages resist model variability and natural
                variations. Compare a future (like 2070&ndash;2099) to a
                historical reference (like 1981&ndash;2010)&mdash;the later the
                reference, the more climate change is already a part of it!
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Summarize data over a region.</strong> Larger areas,
                such as watersheds or planning units, are less affected by local
                variations in elevation, vegetation, etc. than small areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use multiple emissions scenarios.</strong> Humans are
                unpredictable, so pick at least two scenarios that bracket the
                likely range, unless you only want the &ldquo;higher risk&rdquo;
                or &ldquo;lower risk&rdquo; case. RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 are good
                choices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Use multiple models and/or an average.</strong> All
                models are plausible, if not equally likely. Use several models
                if the full range of possibilities is important to your work.
                Use a model average if you&rsquo;re more interested in the most
                likely outputs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Include medium-term and longer-term futures.</strong> A
                comprehensive assessment would consider a historical, a mid-21st
                century future, and a late-21st century future. The two futures
                should each have a high, low, and middle range, with multiple
                models and multiple emission scenarios in each future window.

              Northern Climate Reports employs these (and more) models, all of
              which perform well in the North, so that data users can think
              broadly about the range of possible futures.
              <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.03.021"
                >See this paper</a

              downscaling of model output.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)</strong> have
              been developed for the climate modeling community as a basis for
              modeling experiments. RCPs portray possible future greenhouse gas
              and aerosol emissions scenarios. RCP scenarios are not specific
              policies, demographics, or economic futures; instead, they are
              defined by total solar radiative forcing (atmospheric energy
              changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions, measured in watts per
              square meter) by 2100.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>RCP 4.5</strong>: the concentration of atmospheric
                carbon that warms Earth at an average of 4.5
                watts/m<sup>2</sup>. In this scenario, emissions peak around
                2040 and then decline.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>RCP 8.5</strong>: the concentration of atmospheric
                carbon that warms Earth at an average of 8.5
                watts/m<sup>2</sup>. In this scenario, emissions continue to
                rise throughout the 21st century. Climate change projected under
                RCP 8.5 will typically be more acute than under RCP 4.5.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 are displayed in Northern Climate Reports,
              allowing users to assess emissions-dependent variability and
              evaluate a moderate scenario alongside a more extreme scenario.
