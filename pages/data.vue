        <h2 class="title is-3">About the data used in this tool</h2>
        <p>
          Data used in this tool consist of inputs and outputs from the
          Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) project. This project originally
          sought to couple several models: the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model
          (TEM), the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab (GIPL) model, and
          ALFRESCO, a stochastic wildfire and landscape model.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tool doesn&rsquo;t offer the full range of data produced for the
          IEM project. If you are looking for models or scenarios not present on
          this site, you can download source data.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title is-3">How to obtain source data</h2>
        <p>
          Data used on this site is distributed from the data repository at the
          Scenarios Network for Alaska + Arctic Planning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset?tags=IEM-Input"
              >Model inputs</a
            >. These data were prepared specifically to support modelling runs
            used in the IEM project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://ckan.snap.uaf.edu/dataset?tags=IEM-Output"
              >Model outputs</a
            >. These data consist of outputs from the model runs performed
            through the IEM project.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There, you can filter and search for specific datasets and variables
          of interest to download the full range of model and scenario options.
          These data generally offered as gridded multiband GeoTIFF products.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Data API access</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to downloading source data as GeoTIFFs, all the data that
          are used in this web tool may be accessed via an API. Links to API
          endpoints are listed below.
